# chapo-smokie-random
A website that generates and shows random images for chapo smokie(Smocha).
This is a simple fun project I am doing because I am bored and I need to help my github look healthy.
This website will be hosted on Amazon S3 but I can't bother to add a custom domain.
The link : 

Also thi is where I will learn things like branch merging,github issues and small things like pull requests.

Feel free to add onto the project
